    "# Exercise 4, Problem 2: Robot localization using particle filtering\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the lecture we have learned particle filtering, which can be interpreted as a Monte Carlo method for Hidden Markov Models. In this exercise, we learn how to use this method to track a moving robot's position over time. In this setting, we have access to the steering and velocity control inputs. We also have sensors that measure the distances to visible landmarks. The basic principle of particle filtering is then that the population of particles tracks the high-likelihood regions of the robot's position.\n",

    "## Understanding the result\n",
    "We can see that the prediction of final position with no noise is not always the best result. Sometimes the prediction with some noise works better. You can relate it to the the gradient descent method when we want to find the minumum value of a non-convex. For example if we get stuck in some local minimum, performing random walks helps to eacape from this local minima. Same is hold for particle filters with different noise levels. Once the minimum offset for particles with no noise is decided, it will always be there and can never be eliminated. But with different noise level, particles may come to some smaller offset. You can also load another given test data to see the movement on a new map."
